    "curryosityDesc": "BasketballCurryosity (Summer 2023) is an interactive website that I developed with a friend, aimed at basketball fans (NBA). Built entirely in React, with Firebase for data management and Figma for user experience design, the site features four engaging quiz games that challenge usersâ€™ knowledge of the NBA. Throughout this project, I had the chance to deepen my web development skills, focusing on React and Firebase, and enhance my design abilities using Figma. Additionally, I ventured into promoting the site by learning to use CapCut for creating engaging videos to share on social media, a new passion that further enriched my experience.",
